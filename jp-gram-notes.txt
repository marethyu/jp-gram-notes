ても can be translated to "no matter how/who/what" or "whether" just to make sense in English, or sometimes ignored. So in this case, "No matter how I battle, I'm strong." or even "When I battle, I'm strong."

Here are some examples that don't translate well to "even if":

による/によって/により

2) depending on ~ (when highlighting differences)
3) by (a method/way/means)

Three meanings of でもない.

> 1. (exp) neither... nor... (with the implication that there are other "nor..." items)
>
> 2. denying explicitly one thing and also denying implicitly other things as well
>
> 3. not like (you); not (your) usual self

1. でもない is similar to じゃない = ではない but with a sense of inclusion (due to the も particle). Suppose I'm negating A, B, and C, I can write something like this

> Aではない。Bでもない。Bでもない。

Using the grammatical properties of も, it can be simplified to

> AでもBでもBでもない。

2. Suppose you told yourself:「大した人間でもない」. It means something like "I'm not a wonderful person (also reliable person, leader, famous person, etc.)" ie. "I'm nobody."

Vてやる

1. Give something to someone of lower status. Can be used to as expression og anger.
2. Someone does something undesirable to someone else when he/she knows his/her action will cause hardship or trouble. See https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/grammar/dojg/dojgpages/intermediate%E3%82%84%E3%82%8B2.html
3. To (proactively) perform an action so as to prove one's ability to others.

(つまり)～～ってことか means "(So,) does it mean...?"
**つまり is not necessary and is optional

「～ってことだ」 means "That means..."

ということだ (similar to つまり～だ) means: (conclusion) in other words, ...

わけ Intuition:

Cause/conclusion are in the same relationship.

わけ = *underlying* "reasonality"/cause

Forward "reasonality": It is raining therefore I'm wet.
Backward "reasonality": I'm wet therefore it is raining.

そんなわけで = by that such reasonality, ... (might mean "that's why")
というわけで = by this reasonality, ... (almost like だから)
XというわけでY - Y because X; X, so Y; Y is a conclusion from X
〇〇という理由で　&　〇〇というわけで　For that reason; on the grounds of _____, ...; That's why; Thus; In conclusion; That being the case
ということで is almost equivalent to というわけで, but mostly used for hearsay
というわけで we explain the reason/cause of situation and with ということで we explain specifics

わかる - to break down (by itself) and to be analyzed and then understood (to me)
わけがわからない - incomprehensible; lit: reasonality is not be able to be understood

わけじゃない:

"It is not the reasonality that... from..."

Take sentence A and sentence B, which is a conclusion for A, then deny that B conclusion can't be drawn from A. In other words, deny there is *underlying logical link* between B and A, not necessary situation itself.

Y=Xわけじゃない => Y doesn't have reasonality of entailing X.

わけがない:

"There is no reasonality for..."

Xわけ(が)ない => X does not have any reasonality.

Three implications:
1. Therefore X is not true.
2. Literally, reasonality for X does not exist, but X exist (or not) with no reason (e.g. 彼はそんなに金が要るわけがない => it doesn't matter if he have that amount of money or not, reason for needing not exist).
3. Hyperbole meaning 簡単. わけないこと means something that doesn't have any reasonality. In other words, something that doesn't need brains to figure out the underlying reasonality. This thing is simple enough to exist with no reason.

わけに（は・も）いかない:

"it’s not proper that..." or "it's not possible that..."

Literally means "doesn't go to that reasonality."

Under certain circumstances/ due to some reason* you can’t afford to do  ~ / you have no other choice but do ~.

*The reason can be one’s personal reason, moral, common sense, socially accepted idea, one’s sense of justice.

Involves one’s strong will.

わけにはいかない sounds stronger than わけにもいかない

Summary of わけ usage:
1. [Conclusion]: Fact -> Thus, (it is case that) Conclusion (使い方: Conclusionわけ)
2. [Marks a reason or cause for some matter]: Fact -> It is because/due to Reason; It is conclusion of Reason (使い方: Reasonわけ)
3. [Acceptance/Acknowledgement of some truth]: (Fact -> Why? ->) Reason/Cause -> This is Fact's reason (使い方: Factわけ)
4. [Marks a restatement or summary of some fact]: Fact -> (In other words) it is summary that Summary (使い方: (つまり) Summaryわけ)
5. Nothing

わけではない

lit “It is not the reason (why)” / “It’s not the case” / “It doesn’t mean.”

use when we want to say It doesn’t mean that., It’s not like 〜. , It’s not the case that 〜., I don’t mean that〜., That is not why 〜., That is not the reason 〜., It is not really 〜., not to do much〜., not necessarily, not altogether 〜., not particularly 〜.

わけがない means "There is NO WAY that 〜, it is impossible that 〜, can’t be"

わけでもない

The meaning is almost the same as わけではない (It doesn’t exactly mean ~, etc.)

You use わけでもない
1) when you negate a couple of things.
(Aのわけでもないし)Bのわけでもない。
(It doesn’t mean A) It doesn’t either mean B.

Ex.（彼女が嫌いになったわけでもないし）彼女と別れようと思っているわけでもない。
= (It doesn’t mean I stop liking her) I am not thinking about breaking up with her.

2) When someone tells you something, and you negate the possibility in a subtle way.

A: どうして今日は、出かけないの？　疲れたの？
= How come you don’t go out today? Are you tired?
B : そういうわけでもないんだけど…
= Not exactly but…

1) わけではない denies stronger than わけでもない

A) そういうわけではない That is not the reason / That is not the case /
B) そういうわけでもない Not exactly

わけでもない sounds more vague and it implies that could be a part of the reason.

2) However there are cases わけでもない emphasizes more than わけではない like “even”

C) 先生になるわけではない (It doesn’t mean (this person) will become a teacher.)
D) 先生になるわけでもない ((This person) won’t become “even” a teacher)

だって

1. even
2. also
3. similar to たって - no matter what or even if/although
3. but/because
4. someone said/wrote (だと + quotative verb like 呼ぶ)
5. From #4, 「だって」 can expresses one's surprise, criticism, etc. toward the statement that is being quoted. (e.g. 弟子にしろだと, spoken by Sasuke when Boruto request him to make him his student)

Someone will くれる to you. You will もらう from someone. You will あげる to someone.

Sentences ending in て-form

1. Indicates request (くれ/ください/くれる is removed)
2. Reason for previous statement or some unspoken statement... (sometimes, it's an example of sentence inversion)
3. Implies speaker is not finished and has more to say.

See https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/60762/%E3%81%A6-form-at-end-of-phrase-but-not-being-used-for-requests/

Causual relationship becomes more indirect in this order: ないから, ないので, ないで and なくて (change the part after な to ず ( = zu) or ずに ( = zuni) in more literal sentence).

って

1. Colloquial topic marker, can mean something like は, というのは, のは, etc.
2. Colloquial version of と (usually indicate emitted verb like 言う; if conditional; must not)
3. Variant of ってば
