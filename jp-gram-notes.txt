日本語文法ノート

Notes on て形 expressions:

Vている:

- Can be understood literally as "V exists"
- Indicates continuous action, continuous state, or habitual action (def of present tense)

Vてある:

- Indicates: Someone did something to X (usually for purpose) (Thus, Verbて is usually a transitive verb) and X is still in that state.

Vておく:

- Either mean "to do something in advance for future" (準備) or "to something and put its results in place" (ie. to leave a situation as it is for now or for some time, does not always indicate preparation for future) (放置)
- With a causative verb, Verbておく usually express the idea that someone lets someone or something remain in his/its present state.

「Vていく」と「Vてくる」の意味

Possible meanings:
1. Describes leaving somewhere for temporary time for a trivial purpose (then come back). No Vていく form of this pattern.
2. Do something somewhere and then move on. Both Vていく and Vてくる are used
3. Vてくる describes situation continually changing from past to present (speaker's point of view). Vていく is for action that will continue to change from present (speaker's point of view) to future. (Used with verbs that express change.)
4. Vてきた is present perfect tense; Vていく is for continuation from present to future. Speaker's focus is on present or specified time. Often used with 今まで and これから. (Describes temporal continuation.)
5. Means of movement, situations, and actions occurring in tandem during motion. Both Vていく and Vてくる are used
6. For leaving or approaching speaker or topic by giving directionality to verbs of movement or verbs that have meaning of movement. Verbs of movement include 歩く, 走る, 通る, 飛ぶ, and 流れる. These words have no intrinsic directionality, so Vてくる or Vていくare appended for directionality.
7. For leaving or approaching speaker for verb pairs of motion. Use of ていく or てくる depends on speaker's point of view. Verb pairs of motion include 入る, 出る, 上がる, 下りる, のぼる, くだる, 乗る, 降りる, etc.
8. Things or sensations (odors, voices, etc.) approach speaker. Only てくる used.
9. Beginning or emergence of change. Used with natural occurrences regardless of speaker's volition. Often used for psychological or emotive sensations. No Vていく form.

ても can be translated to "no matter how/who/what" or "whether" just to make sense in English, or sometimes ignored. So in this case, "No matter how I battle, I'm strong." or even "When I battle, I'm strong."

Here are some examples that don't translate well to "even if":

俺は誰が見ても天才だ。

No matter who looked (=As anyone can see), I'm a genius.

による/によって/により

1) caused by ~ / due to ~ : something happens/happened because of ~ (a reason)
2) depending on ~ (when highlighting differences)
3) by (a method/way/means)

Three meanings of でもない.

> 1. (exp) neither... nor... (with the implication that there are other "nor..." items)
>
> 2. denying explicitly one thing and also denying implicitly other things as well
>
> 3. not like (you); not (your) usual self

1. でもない is similar to じゃない = ではない but with a sense of inclusion (due to the も particle). Suppose I'm negating A, B, and C, I can write something like this

> Aではない。Bでもない。Bでもない。

Using the grammatical properties of も, it can be simplified to

> AでもBでもBでもない。

2. Suppose you told yourself:「大した人間でもない」. It means something like "I'm not a wonderful person (also reliable person, leader, famous person, etc.)" ie. "I'm nobody."

Vてやる

1. Give something to someone of lower status. Can be used to as expression og anger.
2. Someone does something undesirable to someone else when he/she knows his/her action will cause hardship or trouble. See https://itazuraneko.neocities.org/grammar/dojg/dojgpages/intermediate%E3%82%84%E3%82%8B2.html
3. To (proactively) perform an action so as to prove one's ability to others.

かける/かかる meanings:

The basic meaning is something among "to hang", "to hook", "to put", and "sprinkle." It is often used metaphorically.

連用形+かける has two meanings:「to be partway doing ...; to begin (but not complete) ...; to be about to (literally: hang on to action)」and「indicates (verb) is being directed to (someone) (literally: hang action on someone)」

(つまり)～～ってことか means "(So,) does it mean...?"
**つまり is not necessary and is optional

「～ってことだ」 means "That means..."

ということだ (similar to つまり～だ) means: (conclusion) in other words, ...

The FULL name of volitional form (う-auxiliary) is volitional-presumptive-hortative form. (意志・推量・勧誘) So:

夜11時だし俺もう寝よう is volitional.

ねぇねぇ、一緒に食べよう is hortative (persuasive).

通常の五倍はあろう is presumptive.

わけ Intuition:

Cause/conclusion are in the same relationship.

わけ = *underlying* "reasonality"/cause

Forward "reasonality": It is raining therefore I'm wet.
Backward "reasonality": I'm wet therefore it is raining.

そんなわけで = by that such reasonality, ... (might mean "that's why")
というわけで = by this reasonality, ... (almost like だから)
XというわけでY - Y because X; X, so Y; Y is a conclusion from X
〇〇という理由で　&　〇〇というわけで　For that reason; on the grounds of _____, ...; That's why; Thus; In conclusion; That being the case
ということで is almost equivalent to というわけで, but mostly used for hearsay
というわけで we explain the reason/cause of situation and with ということで we explain specifics

わかる - to break down (by itself) and to be analyzed and then understood (to me)
わけがわからない - incomprehensible; lit: reasonality is not be able to be understood

わけじゃない:

"It is not the reasonality that... from..."

Take sentence A and sentence B, which is a conclusion for A, then deny that B conclusion can't be drawn from A. In other words, deny there is *underlying logical link* between B and A, not necessary situation itself.

Y=Xわけじゃない => Y doesn't have reasonality of entailing X.

わけがない:

"There is no reasonality for..."

Xわけ(が)ない => X does not have any reasonality.

Three implications:
1. Therefore X is not true.
2. Literally, reasonality for X does not exist, but X exist (or not) with no reason (e.g. 彼はそんなに金が要るわけがない => it doesn't matter if he have that amount of money or not, reason for needing not exist).
3. Hyperbole meaning 簡単. わけないこと means something that doesn't have any reasonality. In other words, something that doesn't need brains to figure out the underlying reasonality. This thing is simple enough to exist with no reason.

わけに（は・も）いかない:

"it’s not proper that..." or "it's not possible that..."

Literally means "doesn't go to that reasonality."

Under certain circumstances/ due to some reason* you can’t afford to do  ~ / you have no other choice but do ~.

*The reason can be one’s personal reason, moral, common sense, socially accepted idea, one’s sense of justice.

Involves one’s strong will.

わけにはいかない sounds stronger than わけにもいかない

Summary of わけ usage:
1. [Conclusion]: Fact -> Thus, (it is case that) Conclusion (使い方: Conclusionわけ)
2. [Marks a reason or cause for some matter]: Fact -> It is because/due to Reason; It is conclusion of Reason (使い方: Reasonわけ)
3. [Acceptance/Acknowledgement of some truth]: (Fact -> Why? ->) Reason/Cause -> This is Fact's reason (使い方: Factわけ)
4. [Marks a restatement or summary of some fact]: Fact -> (In other words) it is summary that Summary (使い方: (つまり) Summaryわけ)
5. Nothing

わけではない

lit “It is not the reason (why)” / “It’s not the case” / “It doesn’t mean.”

use when we want to say It doesn’t mean that., It’s not like 〜. , It’s not the case that 〜., I don’t mean that〜., That is not why 〜., That is not the reason 〜., It is not really 〜., not to do much〜., not necessarily, not altogether 〜., not particularly 〜.

わけがない means "There is NO WAY that 〜, it is impossible that 〜, can’t be"

わけでもない

The meaning is almost the same as わけではない (It doesn’t exactly mean ~, etc.)

You use わけでもない
1) when you negate a couple of things.
(Aのわけでもないし)Bのわけでもない。
(It doesn’t mean A) It doesn’t either mean B.

Ex.（彼女が嫌いになったわけでもないし）彼女と別れようと思っているわけでもない。
= (It doesn’t mean I stop liking her) I am not thinking about breaking up with her.

2) When someone tells you something, and you negate the possibility in a subtle way.

A: どうして今日は、出かけないの？　疲れたの？
= How come you don’t go out today? Are you tired?
B : そういうわけでもないんだけど…
= Not exactly but…

1) わけではない denies stronger than わけでもない

A) そういうわけではない That is not the reason / That is not the case /
B) そういうわけでもない Not exactly

わけでもない sounds more vague and it implies that could be a part of the reason.

2) However there are cases わけでもない emphasizes more than わけではない like “even”

C) 先生になるわけではない (It doesn’t mean (this person) will become a teacher.)
D) 先生になるわけでもない ((This person) won’t become “even” a teacher)

A combination ～ようと of a volitional and と can be also used adverbially to signify “trying to (do)” or “in an attempt to (do).”
Verb (volitional) + と+ Verb: As part of an effort to do {first verb}, the person does {second verb} This is a variation of the ようとする pattern.

電話に出ようと立ち上がる stand up (trying) to answer the telephone
星をつかもうと手を伸ばす extend one’s arm trying to grab a star
彼の返事を聞こうと電話をかけた。

に見える
    Used when a thing appears like something to the speaker.

Example:  灰色と黒の世界の中、彼女だけが色付きに見えた。(It was like she was the only thing with color, in the middle of a gray and black world)
女に見える (He looks like / could pass for a woman)
夕方に人の影が化物に見えた (At dusk, the shadows of people looked like monsters.)

～のか、～
Form: {A guess that would explain why} + なのか, {Observation}
	Used when the speaker states what happens, and while wondering takes a guess why.
Example: 木々の影に隠れたのか、彼女の姿はなかった。
彼はここの学生なのか、この辺を良く知っている。

せいか
Form: {Possible cause + のせいか、result}    
    Used when the speaker states the result and also wonders if the prior thing could be the cause. Unlike せい, せいか can be used with a positive cause and effect.
Example: 空気が綺麗なせいか、空の青いが東京より軽く、爽やかだった。
    天気のせいか、人出があんまりよくない。

だって

1. even
2. also
3. similar to たって - no matter what or even if/although
3. but/because
4. someone said/wrote (だと + quotative verb like 呼ぶ)
5. From #4, 「だって」 can expresses one's surprise, criticism, etc. toward the statement that is being quoted. (e.g. 弟子にしろだと, spoken by Sasuke when Boruto request him to make him his student)

あげる/くれる/もらう notes:

あげる: give (up to other)

(giver)がreceiverに~あげる

- Requires giver's POV (not limited to you). 
- Vてあげる = do something to other

くれる: give (down to me/us)

giverが(receiver)に~くれる (push -> download)

- Requires receiver's POV (yourself or somebody close to you).
- First person (receiver) can never be subjects in くれる sentences.
- Needs giver's initiative.
- Vてくれる = somebody do action for me/us.
- Used with favorable actions directed towards you.
- If an action is directed towards you does not end with てくれる, you are neutrally describing the action or the action is somewhat disfavorable to you.
- Can be used sarcastically when someone does something unpleasant to you.
- The opposite of くれる is V-masu-stem　+ やがる. It is used show that an action disfavorable to you.

もらう: make someone do a "service" to me/us

receiverがgiverに/から~もらう (user-initialized pull -> download)

- The actor/receiver of もらう can be you or somebody else. You can talk about other people もらうing.
- Needs user's initiative.
- Vてもらう = "I got someone do something to me/us"
- Is receiver-centered, unlike くれる which is giver-centered. Has no participating giver. Giver is not needed most of time.
- Vてもらう is almost like [somebody]にVさせる (causative)

TL;DR: Someone will くれる to you. You will もらう from someone. You will あげる to someone.

させてもらう:

させていただきます (humble form, flowery version of 致す)

Meanings:
- Allow me to do XXX
- I take a pleasure of doing XXX
- I receive your causation/allowing for me to do XXX

[ACTOR]が[DIRECTOR]に[ACTION]させてもらう = "[ACTOR] (will) get/receive [DIRECTOR]'s allowing/causation to perform [ACTION]"

In regards to your *own* request, you always say XXXさせてもらう

私が Bに やらせてもらう = I receive B's allowance to do.

Bが 私に やらせてくれる = B let me do.

The nuance is that in ~もらう, I wanted to do, so whether B permitted or not I intend to do anyway. In ~くれる, the spotlight is on B's permission.

Example:

When you write 質問させてもらいます in LearnJapanese before asking question. It means "Allow me to ask a question." It is a request to FOR & FROM myself TO the LearnJapanese community, and I’m going to do it, of course.

Sentences ending in て-form

1. Indicates request (くれ/ください/くれる is removed)
2. Reason for previous statement or some unspoken statement... (sometimes, it's an example of sentence inversion)
3. Implies speaker is not finished and has more to say.
4. The te-form is sometimes used with an irritating voice to point out someone's bad or surprising behavior. For example, a mom may say "またこんなに散らかして!" ("You've made such a mess of the room again!") to her child (commom with やがる).

See https://japanese.stackexchange.com/questions/60762/%E3%81%A6-form-at-end-of-phrase-but-not-being-used-for-requests/

Causual relationship becomes more indirect in this order: ないから, ないので, ないで and なくて (change the part after な to ず ( = zu) or ずに ( = zuni) in more literal sentence).

って

1. Colloquial topic marker, can mean something like は, というのは, のは, etc.
2. Colloquial version of と (usually indicate emitted verb like 言う; if conditional; must not)
3. Variant of ってば

ってゆうか,っていうか,っつーか,っつうか,つーか,てゆーか,ってか,てか

敬語まとめ
========

Types:

尊敬語 (respectful language): Refers to any language that directly pays respect towards whomever it's used towards. any words in this category raise the person in question of status, so any words in this category are super rude if used towards oneself (important). on the flipside, it's super respectful to use this towards people you want to show respect to.

謙譲語 (humble language; previously known as 謙譲語１): Refers to any language that add humility to whoever it's used towards. any words in this category lower (or raise) the person is question of status, so any words in this category are super rude if used towards the other person. on the flipside, it's super polite to use this towards yourself as it shows you're being humble.

丁寧語 (polite language): Refers to any language that just... sounds polite. it's not humble, it's not respect-showing, just polite. it's often used to refer to です　ます forms.

丁重語 (courteous language; previously known as 謙譲語２): Basically the exact same as 謙譲語 with the difference being that it's used to refer to situations where the other party isn't present (いたす、申す、参る etc fall under this category).

美化語 (beautification words; previously part of 丁寧語): Refers to language that shows respect simply by sounding more socially proper (specifically お/ご). this is easily confusable with 尊敬語, as many お/ご words directly pay respect to the other party. the only way one can know if a word pays respect to the other party or just sounds polite in general is through exposure. you can use 美化語 to refer to yourself, but you can't 尊敬語

Politeness depends on how much 敬語 is used.

Some notes:
- When using 謙譲語, です, であります, and でございます are used to refer to yourself, but never でいらっしゃいます because いらっしゃる is 尊敬語.
- When using 尊敬語, でいらっしゃいます is used for animate objects while でございます is used for inanimate objects (ございます <-> ある; いらっしゃいます <-> いる).
- To make a verb humble: お/ご + V-masu-stem + する
- To make a verb honorific: お/ご + V-masu-stem + になる or conjugate into passive form (sometimes both)
- Another way make a verb honorific: お/ご + V-masu-stem + です
- Polite request: お/ご + V-masu-stem + ください
- Make a honorific request: Conjugate the honorific verb to the special masu-conjugation and replace the last 「す」 with 「せ」 (An abbreviated and less formal version of this is to simply remove the 「ます」 after conjugating to the special masu-form: 下さる -> 下さいます -> 下さい)
- させていただきます (see notes on させてもらう)
